# Creating a Mount function

In this lesson we watch Evan build the mount function from the challenge  he gave us in the last video.  This code allows us to take a render  function, return a simple Virtual Node, and then the mount function will make the appropriate DOM JavaScript calls to create the Virtual Node in the browser.  Here is [a codepen](https://codepen.io/GreggPollack/pen/zYvdpmr) with his solution for the mount function.

At the end Evan then challenges us to also write the Patch function,  which takes two Virtual DOM nodes and makes the appropriate DOM calls to update the page.  You can access the starting code in [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GreggPollack/pen/xxwLYbq?editors=1000).
