# Parting Words

In this final short video, I ask Evan a few questions like how to get  started looking through Vue source code.  Evan recommends learning  TypeScript, because the type information essentially serves as  additional documentation.  He also recommends looking through the way  React does hooks because it is similar to the Composition API.  Lastly  he mentions that the Vuetify is a great example of how to use render  functions powerfully.
